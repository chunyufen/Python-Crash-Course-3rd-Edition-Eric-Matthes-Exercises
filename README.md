I learnt Python from the book, _PYTHON Crash Course 3rd edition_ , authored by Eric Matthes, published by No Starch Press.

The material in the book is also explained in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqHZhNwYH90&list=PLiEts138s9P1A6rXyg4KZQiNBB_qTkq9V) by Eric Matthes.

The author provided the codes used in the book (3rd edition) in [Github](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_3e).

The author also provided solutions to exercises set out in the _second edition_ in [Github](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/solutions/solutions/).
